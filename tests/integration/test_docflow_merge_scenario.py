"""Integration test: DocFlow merge workflow with concurrent signals and reviews.

Scenario: A published PRD (Advanced Analytics) has been in review on SharePoint for 2 weeks.
During that time:
1. Local synthesis: 3 Sense signals (meeting notes, GitLab discussion, voice memo)
   have been processed and drafted as revision suggestions
2. Remote changes: 4 reviewers made concurrent comments, tracked changes, and
   content edits on the SharePoint version
3. Divergence: Both .md and external doc have evolved independently
4. Merge task: DocFlow must perform semantic merge using Neut's RAG context

This test validates the complete workflow without assuming Git or live APIs,
focusing on the merge logic and signal synthesis.

**[published] v2.0.0** | February 10, 2026

**Related Modules:** Experiment Manager (upstream data), Dashboard (display)

## Executive Summary

The Advanced Analytics module provides statistical analysis, visualization, and
reporting capabilities for experiment data. It transforms raw measurements into
actionable insights through configurable analysis pipelines.

### Key Features
- Real-time statistical analysis (t-tests, correlations, regression)
- Customizable dashboards and report generation
- Integration with experimental metadata and provenance tracking

## Core Requirements

### R1: Statistical Analysis Engine
The system shall support parametric and non-parametric tests on experimental data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC1.1: Support t-tests with 95% confidence reporting
- AC1.2: Support Pearson and Spearman correlations
- AC1.3: Log all analysis decisions in audit trail

### R2: Visualization Pipeline
The system shall render plots and charts suitable for publication.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC2.1: Support matplotlib, plotly backends
- AC2.2: Generate high-resolution figures for papers (300+ DPI)
- AC2.3: Support LaTeX rendering for scientific notation

## Design Approach

### Statistical Analysis Flow
```
Raw Data → Validation → Analysis → Results → Audit Log
```

The system shall:
1. Validate input data quality
2. Apply selected statistical test
3. Generate results with confidence intervals
4. Record all parameters and decisions

## Open Questions

- Q1: Should we support Bayesian methods initially, or defer to v3?
- Q2: How do we handle missing data imputation?
- Q3: What's the max dataset size we need to support?

## Success Metrics

- 95% accuracy on statistical calculations (validated against R/scipy)
- < 2s analysis time for datasets < 100k rows
- Zero unreviewed statistical methods in production
