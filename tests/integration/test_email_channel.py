"""Integration tests for the Outlook Email channel.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED — Email ingestion requires either:
  a) MS Graph API with Mail.Read scope (preferred), or
  b) An IMAP/SMTP integration

This file documents the planned architecture and serves as
the skeleton for when the extractor is built.

Planned flow:
  1. MS Graph: poll inbox for emails matching a filter/label
  2. Extract body text + attachments
  3. Route text through freetext extractor
  4. Route attachments through appropriate extractors (.m4a → voice, etc.)

See: tools/agents/config.example/facility.toml
