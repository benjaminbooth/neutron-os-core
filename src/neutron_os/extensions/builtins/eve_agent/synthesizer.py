"""Synthesizer — merges extracted signals into changelog drafts.

Takes all Signal objects from all extractors, groups by initiative and
signal_type, and produces:
1. drafts/changelog_YYYY-MM-DD.md — tab-separated paste-ready format
2. drafts/weekly_summary_YYYY-MM-DD.md — prose summary

Signal staleness tracking:
- Signals are hashed and tracked in signal_manifest.json
- By default, only unreported signals are included in changelogs
- Use include_all=True to see all signals (e.g., for full audit)

Deduplication:
- Exact: signals with the same signal_id (content hash) are merged
- Fuzzy: within the same initiative+type group, signals with very similar
  detail text are merged (keeps highest-confidence version)
- Temporal: within the same initiative+type, keep only the most recent
  signal when two describe the same workflow stage at different times
