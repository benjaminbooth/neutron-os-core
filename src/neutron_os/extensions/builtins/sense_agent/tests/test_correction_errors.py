"""Tests for correction error flagging and learning.

These tests verify that:
1. Corrections auto-apply (non-blocking)
2. Downstream errors can be flagged
3. Flagged errors become negative examples
4. Future corrections avoid flagged patterns

Real-world example from 2026-02-24:
- LLM incorrectly suggested "jet design" → "JEDI"
- Context: "that's legit. Yeah, that's all a jet design"
- Actual: "jet design" was likely "legit" (phonetic mishearing)
- Problem: LLM pattern-matched to JEDI initiative, ignored context
