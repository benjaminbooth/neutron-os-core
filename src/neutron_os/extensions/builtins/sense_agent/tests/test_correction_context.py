"""Tests for correction context extraction and audio timing.

BUG DISCOVERED 2026-02-24:
When reviewing corrections, the context text shown does NOT contain the
original term being corrected. Similarly, the audio clips don't play
the segment where the term was spoken.

Example from real data:
  Original:  "social director"
  Context:   "...... use, and a complete evaluation of that experiment needs ..."

The context should contain "social director" but it doesn't!

Root cause to investigate:
1. Context is extracted from the transcript using the original text
2. If the LLM returns an "original" text that doesn't exactly match, find() returns -1
3. The fallback returns empty context which gets truncated

These tests ensure:
1. Context extraction includes the original term
2. Audio timing points to the segment containing the term
3. Review display shows useful information for human judgment
