"""Human-in-the-loop approval gate.

Classifies actions as read-only (auto-approve) or write (require human
confirmation). For safety-adjacent nuclear facility operations, all writes
must be explicitly approved.

Usage:
    gate = ApprovalGate()

    # Read-only → auto-approved
    action = create_action("query_docs")
    gate.submit(action)  # action.status == APPROVED

    # Write → pending human approval
    action = create_action("doc_publish", {"source": "docs/requirements/prd_foo.md"})
    gate.submit(action)  # action.status == PENDING
    gate.pending()       # [action]
    gate.approve(action.action_id)  # action.status == APPROVED
