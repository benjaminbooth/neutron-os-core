# Product Requirements Document: Scheduling System

**Module:** Cross-Cutting Scheduling Infrastructure  
**Status:** Draft  
**Last Updated:** January 22, 2026  
**Stakeholder Input:** Jim (TJ), Khiloni Shah, Nick Luciano  
**Related Modules:** [Experiment Manager](experiment-manager-prd.md), [Reactor Ops Log](reactor-ops-log-prd.md), [Medical Isotope](medical-isotope-prd.md)  
**Parent:** [Executive PRD](neutron-os-executive-prd.md)

## Executive Summary

The Scheduling System is a **cross-cutting concern** that provides unified time management across all Neutron OS modules. It handles reactor time allocation, facility bookings, staff assignments, maintenance windows, and regulatory inspection scheduling. Rather than each module implementing its own scheduling logic, this centralized system ensures consistency, prevents conflicts, and provides holistic visibility.

**Key Principle:** Scheduling is about **time slot allocation and conflict resolution**, not about the specifics of what happens in those slots. The Experiment Manager, Reactor Ops Log, and other modules consume scheduling services but don't own them.

## User Stories

### Schedule Requesters

1. **As a researcher**, I want to see all available reactor time slots for next week so I can plan my experiment.

2. **As a maintenance engineer**, I want to block out 4 hours for pump replacement with automatic notifications to affected users.

3. **As a training coordinator**, I want to ensure each operator gets their 4 hours/quarter requalification scheduled before deadlines.

4. **As a medical isotope customer**, I want to see available production slots that meet my delivery requirements.

### Schedule Managers

5. **As a reactor manager**, I want to review all pending schedule requests in one place with conflict indicators.

6. **As a reactor manager**, I want to set recurring maintenance windows (e.g., "Every Tuesday 6-8 AM") that automatically block scheduling.

7. **As a shift supervisor**, I want to see staffing levels for next week to identify coverage gaps.

8. **As a facility director**, I want monthly utilization reports showing scheduled vs. actual usage by category.

### Schedule Consumers

9. **As a reactor operator**, I want to see the next 4 hours of scheduled activities on my console display.

10. **As any staff member**, I want to see today's facility schedule on the entrance display when I arrive.

11. **As a researcher**, I want automatic email/SMS reminders 24 hours before my scheduled reactor time.

12. **As a compliance officer**, I want to verify that all required training was completed within regulatory timeframes.

## Technical Requirements

### Performance

- Schedule queries return in <200ms for week view
- Support 1000+ schedule items per month
- Handle 50+ concurrent schedule viewers
- Real-time updates to all displays within 5 seconds

### Reliability

- 99.9% uptime for viewing schedules
- Graceful degradation if external calendars unavailable
- Offline-first design for read-only schedule access
- Audit trail of all schedule changes

**See also:** [Master Tech Spec § 9.4: Phased Deployment Topology](../specs/neutron-os-master-tech-spec.md#94-phased-deployment-topology) and [§ 9.6: System Resilience & Offline-First Pattern](../specs/neutron-os-master-tech-spec.md#96-system-resilience--offline-first-pattern)

The Scheduling System implements offline-first patterns to support facility operations during cloud outages:
- **Local cache**: SQLite replica of schedules synced daily at minimum
- **Outage behavior**: Serves read-only schedules from local cache; changes queued for sync when online
- **Facility displays**: Independent local data sources prevent single point of failure
- **Phased deployment**: Control room displays work even if facility server is offline; facility server works even if cloud is offline

### Security

- Role-based access to approval functions
- Immutable audit log of approvals
- Encryption of external calendar credentials
- Rate limiting on public schedule views
