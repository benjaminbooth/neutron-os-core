# Design Loop Architecture

**The Product Development Feedback Loop for NeutronOS**

## Vision

Build the most adapted and finely tuned operating system by:
1. Building a continuous Sense → Synthesize → Create → Publish → Sense loop
2. Measuring loop health metrics
3. Increasing feedback loop velocity over time

### 1. SENSE — Signal Extraction

**What:** Extract signals from all sources
**Who:** Product, Design, Build (humans + agents)
**Sources:**
- Calendar, notes, voice memos, Slack, email
- User feedback (usability studies, support tickets, analytics)
- Code changes (GitLab diffs, PRs, issues)
- Design reviews, iteration feedback
- Operational data (logs, metrics, alerts)

**Outputs:** Raw signals with metadata (source, timestamp, people, type)

### 2. SYNTHESIZE — Pattern Recognition & Actionable Outputs

**What:** Cluster signals, generate actionable artifacts
**Who:** Synthesis agents, Product
**Activities:**
- Cluster signals by PRD/initiative
- Generate PRD updates (requirements, decisions, questions)
- Generate design briefs for designers
- Generate issue drafts for builders
- Generate stakeholder briefings

**Outputs:**
- Updated PRDs
- Design briefs
- Issue drafts
- Briefing narratives

### 3. CREATE — Design & Development

**What:** Produce hardened designs and implementations
**Who:** Designers, Design agents, Builders

**Designers Subscribe To:**
- PRD updates (new requirements, changed scope)
- Early iteration feedback signals
- User feedback on existing designs

**Activities:**
- Combine PRD requirements with sensed feedback
- Iterate on designs with early feedback
- Produce hardened designs (wireframes, specs, prototypes)
- Review with stakeholders

**Outputs:**
- Design specifications
- Wireframes / mockups
- Prototypes
- Implementation-ready specs

### 4. PUBLISH — Delivery to Builders & Users

**What:** Ship designs to builders, features to users
**Who:** Build agents, Builders, DevOps

**Activities:**
- Publish design specs to builders
- Implement features
- Deploy to users
- Instrument for feedback collection

**Outputs:**
- Shipped features
- Instrumented user touchpoints
- Feedback collection mechanisms

### 5. SENSE (again) — User Feedback Loop

**What:** Sense user feedback on shipped features
**Who:** Product, Design, Build (all sensing)
**Signals:**
- **Usefulness:** Does it solve the problem?
- **Ease of use:** Is it intuitive?
- **Joy to use:** Is it delightful?
- **Performance:** Is it fast/reliable?
- **Completeness:** What's missing?

**Sources:**
- User interviews / usability studies
- Support tickets / bug reports
- Analytics (usage patterns, drop-offs)
- NPS / satisfaction surveys
- Social / community feedback

**Outputs:** New signals → feed back into SENSE

## Loop Health Metrics

### Velocity Metrics
| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Cycle Time** | Signal sensed → feature shipped | Decreasing |
| **Sense Latency** | Event occurs → signal captured | < 24 hours |
| **Synthesis Latency** | Signal captured → actionable output | < 4 hours |
| **Create Latency** | Brief received → design complete | Tracked |
| **Publish Latency** | Design approved → shipped | Tracked |
| **Feedback Latency** | Feature shipped → feedback sensed | < 7 days |

### Quality Metrics
| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Signal Quality** | Average confidence of extracted signals | > 0.7 |
| **Synthesis Accuracy** | % of drafts approved without major edits | > 80% |
| **Design Hit Rate** | % of designs that ship without major rework | > 70% |
| **User Satisfaction** | Post-ship feedback (usefulness + ease + joy) | Increasing |
| **Rework Rate** | % of features requiring post-ship fixes | Decreasing |

### Throughput Metrics
| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Signals/Day** | Raw signals captured daily | Tracked |
| **Synthesis/Day** | PRD updates, briefs generated | Tracked |
| **Designs/Week** | Design specs completed | Tracked |
| **Features/Sprint** | Features shipped per sprint | Tracked |

### Health Dashboard
```
Loop Health Score = f(
  velocity_improvement,
  quality_scores,
  throughput_trend,
  feedback_loop_closure_rate
)

Target: Loop Health Score improving quarter-over-quarter
```

## Example Flow

```
Day 1: User complains about confusing experiment setup (SENSE)
        ↓
Day 1: Signal extracted: "Experiment setup UX confusion" → experiment_manager
        ↓
Day 2: Synthesized into design brief for UX improvement (SYNTHESIZE)
        ↓
Day 3: Designer receives brief, starts iteration (CREATE)
        ↓
Day 5: Early prototype shared, feedback sensed (SENSE mini-loop)
        ↓
Day 7: Hardened design published to builders (PUBLISH)
        ↓
Day 10: Feature shipped
        ↓
Day 14: User feedback sensed: "Much clearer now!" (SENSE)
        ↓
Loop Closed. Cycle Time: 14 days. Quality: High.
```

## Open Questions

1. How do we handle conflicting feedback signals?
2. What's the right granularity for loop tracking (feature vs. initiative)?
3. How do agents participate in create/publish stages?
4. How do we measure "joy to use" quantitatively?
5. When does a loop "close" vs. iterate?
