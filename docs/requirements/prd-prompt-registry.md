## The Problem

Every prompt sent to an LLM in this system is assembled ad-hoc in code. There is
no version history, no audit trail, no way to A/B test wording changes, and no
mechanism to swap a few-shot example block without cutting a code release.

### Specific failure modes today

**Hardcoded security preamble.** `gateway.py` contains `_EC_HARDENED_PREAMBLE`, a
string constant defining the non-negotiable security policy injected into every
export-controlled completion. It has no version number. When it changes, git blame
is the only audit trail. There is no test to catch regressions introduced by
rewording it.

**Ad-hoc agent system prompts.** Each agent assembles its system prompt inside its
`run()` method — string concatenation, f-strings, conditionals. Neut, EVE, M-O,
PR-T, and D-FIB each do this independently. Changes to one agent's persona are
invisible to operators reviewing agent behavior in production logs.

**No prompt caching.** The Anthropic API supports `cache_control: {type: "ephemeral"}`
on message blocks, enabling the API to cache static content (preambles, persona
definitions, tool descriptions) across requests. None of this is exploited today.
At agentic loop scale — dozens of tool calls per session, hundreds of sessions per
day — uncached static content is a measurable cost and latency overhead.

**No regression testing for prompts.** When a prompt changes, there is no mechanism
to replay past sessions against the new version to detect behavioral regressions.
The system has no record of which prompt text produced which completion.

**No operator visibility.** An operator reviewing a session log cannot determine
what system prompt the agent was operating under at the time of a given completion.
This is a compliance gap in any deployment requiring audit capability.

## What the Prompt Registry Does

The Prompt Template Registry replaces hardcoded and ad-hoc prompt construction
with a managed artifact system. Prompt templates are named, versioned TOML
documents that compose at runtime — not at deploy time.

### Core capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **Named templates** | Every prompt has a stable `id` (e.g., `ec_hardened_preamble`, `neut_agent_persona`). References in code are IDs, not strings. |
| **Versioned artifacts** | Every change to a template increments its version. Old versions remain accessible. |
| **Layered composition** | Templates compose by layer: Axiom base → domain → extension → per-request override. Same model as the glossary system. |
| **Variable interpolation** | Templates use `{{variable_name}}` slots for dynamic content. Static structure is separate from dynamic injection points. |
| **Cache hints** | Each template declares `cache_hint = true/false`. The gateway uses this to apply `cache_control: {type: "ephemeral"}` on static blocks. |
| **Audit integration** | Every completion log record includes the template ID, version, and content hash used. |

---

## Template Anatomy

A prompt template is a TOML record with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Stable identifier. snake_case. Referenced throughout the codebase. |
| `layer` | string | `"axiom"` \| `"domain"` \| `"extension"` |
| `role` | string | `"system"` \| `"user"` \| `"assistant"` |
| `content` | string | Template body. Use `{{variable_name}}` for interpolation slots. |
| `version` | string | Semver string (e.g., `"1.0.0"`). |
| `cache_hint` | bool | If `true`, static content eligible for Anthropic prompt caching. |
| `tags` | list[string] | Free-form labels for filtering and discovery. |
| `see_also` | list[string] | Related template IDs. |
| `extends` | bool | If `true`, content appends to a same-id template at a lower layer. If `false` (default), this template replaces the lower-layer version. |

Templates that contain only static text (no `{{...}}` slots) and `cache_hint = true`
are the primary targets for Anthropic prompt caching. Variable slots imply dynamic
content and should not be cached.

---

## Composition Model

Templates compose in the same layer order as the glossary system:

```
Axiom base  →  domain layer  →  extension layer  →  per-request override
(lowest)                                              (highest)
```

When two templates share the same `id` at different layers:

- If the higher-layer template has `extends = true`, its content is **appended**
  to the lower-layer content. This is the correct pattern for domain-specific
  addenda to a base preamble.
- If the higher-layer template has `extends = false` (the default), it **replaces**
  the lower-layer template entirely.

Per-request overrides are passed as raw strings to `complete_with_tools()` and
are not stored in the registry. They are always injected after composed template
content and are never cached.

The composed result — the final string after all layers are merged and variables
are interpolated — is what gets sent to the LLM. The `ComposedPrompt` object
carries the content hash of this final string, enabling bit-exact audit comparison.

---

## Use Cases

### EC hardened preamble
The `_EC_HARDENED_PREAMBLE` constant in `gateway.py` migrates to a template with
`id = "ec_hardened_preamble"`, `layer = "axiom"`, `cache_hint = true`. It is fully
static (no variables). Every EC-gated completion will cache this block on the first
call of a session, with subsequent calls in that session hitting cache.

### Agent persona system prompts
Each agent declares a `system_prompt_template` in its `neut-extension.toml`
manifest. The gateway resolves this template at call time. Neut, EVE, M-O, PR-T,
and D-FIB each have their own persona template, independently versioned. Domain
extensions can overlay or extend any of these without modifying builtin code.

### Few-shot example sets
A set of few-shot examples (e.g., signal extraction examples for EVE) is a template
with `cache_hint = true`. It is static content that changes infrequently. Caching
it across sessions in an agentic loop avoids re-sending hundreds of tokens on every
tool call.

### Tool description blocks
When a long list of tool descriptions is injected into a system prompt, that list
is static for the duration of a session. Representing it as a cacheable template
block reduces per-call overhead in tool-heavy agents.

### Per-request context injection slots
Dynamic content (retrieved RAG chunks, session state summaries, user-provided
context) is injected via `{{variable_name}}` slots in templates. These slots are
always non-cached. Separating dynamic slots from static structure maximizes cache
hit rate.

---

## Prompt Caching

The Anthropic API supports up to 4 cache breakpoints per request. Content at each
breakpoint is cached for 5 minutes (ephemeral). Cached content does not count
toward input token billing on subsequent calls.

The registry enables systematic use of this capability:

1. Templates with `cache_hint = true` are identified at load time.
2. The gateway orders message blocks so that cached (static) blocks appear before
   dynamic blocks. This is required by the Anthropic cache semantics: content
   before a cache breakpoint must be identical across requests for the cache to hit.
3. At operator-session scale (dozens of tool calls per session), caching the
   security preamble, agent persona, and tool list on the first call of a session
   means subsequent calls in that session pay only for the dynamic tokens.

This is not a micro-optimization. For agentic loops — where the same system prompt
accompanies 20–50 tool calls in a single session — caching static blocks is a
significant cost and latency reduction. The registry makes this structural rather
than requiring manual per-call bookkeeping.

## Versioning and Audit

Every template change produces a new version. The prior version remains accessible
in the registry (old template files are not deleted; they are tracked in version
control).

Every completion log record includes:
- `prompt_template_id` — the resolved template ID
- `prompt_template_version` — the version string at call time
- `prompt_content_hash` — SHA-256 of the composed, interpolated content

This enables two audit capabilities:

**Change detection.** If behavior changes after a template update, the log diff
between old and new `prompt_template_version` and `prompt_content_hash` pinpoints
exactly what changed and when.

**Regression testing.** Past sessions can be replayed against a new template
version (holding all other inputs constant) to detect behavioral regressions before
promoting the new version to production. This is the foundation of a prompt
regression test suite.

---

## CLI

The `neut prompt` noun provides operator access to the registry. It is implemented
as a utility extension at `src/neutron_os/extensions/builtins/prompt_registry/`.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `neut prompt list` | List all templates. Accepts `--layer` and `--tags` filters. |
| `neut prompt show <id>` | Print the current version of a template, including all metadata. |
| `neut prompt show <id> --version <v>` | Print a specific historical version. |
| `neut prompt diff <id> <v1> <v2>` | Unified diff between two versions of a template. |
| `neut prompt validate` | Check all templates for schema conformance, broken `see_also` references, and undefined `{{variable}}` slots with no default. |

These commands are read-only. Template creation and modification is done via
direct TOML file editing and version control — not through a write API. This
ensures templates are code-reviewed artifacts, not ad-hoc database entries.

---

## Relationship to Agents

Each agent extension declares its system prompt template in `neut-extension.toml`:

```toml
[agent]
system_prompt_template = "neut_agent_persona"   # resolved from registry at call time
```

The gateway resolves this ID at call time. If the template does not exist, the
call fails with a clear error — not a silent fallback to an empty prompt. This
makes misconfiguration visible immediately.

Domain extensions that install custom agents follow the same pattern. They ship
their own `prompt-templates.toml` alongside their extension manifest. Discovery
and composition follow the standard layer order.

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 — Foundation (target: current sprint)

- TOML registry schema finalized.
- `TemplateRegistry` loader implemented in `src/neutron_os/infra/prompt_registry.py`.
- `gateway.py` updated to accept `system_template_id` parameter.
- `_EC_HARDENED_PREAMBLE` constant migrated to `docs/prompt-templates-axiom.toml`
  as template `ec_hardened_preamble`.
- Existing agent `run()` methods refactored to declare template IDs in their
  manifests rather than assembling prompts inline.
- Backward compatibility maintained: if `system_template_id` is `None`, raw
  `system` string is used as before. No breaking change to existing callers.

### Phase 2 — Prompt caching (follow-on)

- Cache hint resolution implemented in gateway.
- Static template blocks (preamble, persona, tool descriptions) wired to
  Anthropic `cache_control: {type: "ephemeral"}`.
- Cache hit rate tracked in completion logs.

### Phase 3 — Versioning and regression (follow-on)

- Template version history accessible via `neut prompt show --version`.
- `neut prompt diff` command implemented.
- Session replay harness for prompt regression testing.
- Prompt template ID, version, and content hash written to every completion log
  record.

## What This Does Not Cover

- **Dynamic prompt generation** (LLM-writes-prompt-for-LLM) is out of scope.
  This registry manages human-authored templates, not machine-generated ones.
- **Template storage backends** other than the filesystem. Templates are TOML
  files tracked in version control. There is no database backend, no API server,
  no remote registry.
- **A/B testing infrastructure.** The registry enables the data collection
  (which template version produced which completion) that makes A/B analysis
  possible, but the analysis tooling is a separate concern.
