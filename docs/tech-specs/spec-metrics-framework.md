# NeutronOS Product Metrics Framework

**Status:** Updated 2026-03-20 — aligned with Axiom platform architecture
**Owner:** Ben Booth
**Origin:** TRIGA Digital Twin project (generalized to NeutronOS)
**Layer:** NeutronOS (product KPIs and business outcomes)

> **Scope of this document:** Product success metrics — business KPIs, user outcomes,
> nuclear domain SLAs, and intelligence platform health as seen by users and operators.
>
> For *platform observability* (instrumentation, alerting, distributed traces, Prometheus
> metrics), see [spec-observability.md](spec-observability.md).
>
> These two documents are complementary. A metric like "RAG relevance score" appears in
> both: here as a product KPI (target >80%, measured by user feedback), and in
> `spec-observability.md` as `axiom_rag_low_confidence_ratio` (a real-time gauge that
> alerts if it crosses a threshold).

> **See also:** [Executive PRD Success Metrics](../requirements/prd-executive.md#success-metrics-platform-wide) for high-level targets.

## 5. Intelligence Platform Metrics

*"Is the AI layer delivering compounding value?"*

These metrics are specific to the Axiom intelligence layer (RAG, LLM gateway, knowledge
maturity pipeline, prompt registry). They track whether the platform improves over time,
not just whether it responds correctly today.

For the underlying instrumentation that feeds these metrics, see
[spec-observability.md §2](spec-observability.md).

| Metric | Definition | Current | Target | Measurement |
|--------|------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| RAG Relevance Score | % of retrieved document sets rated relevant by users | Unknown | >80% | In-session thumbs up/down; `axiom_knowledge_feedback_signals` |
| Knowledge Maturity Rate | % of interactions that produce at least one validated fact | Unknown | >5% after 6 months | `axiom_knowledge_crystallized_total` / `axiom_knowledge_interactions_total` |
| Prompt Cache Hit Ratio | % of LLM calls where static template blocks hit the provider's prompt cache | Unknown | >60% after warm-up | `axiom_prompt_cache_hint_ratio` |
| Agentic RAG Efficiency | % of queries resolved without a second retrieval pass | Unknown | >70% | Retrieval loop count per `trace_id` |
| Crystallization Throughput | Facts approved per week | Unknown | Track growth; positive slope is success | `axiom_knowledge_facts_approved_total` weekly delta |
| Correction Rate | % of interactions with explicit negative feedback (thumbs-down or correction) | Unknown | <10%; alert if >10% sustained | `axiom_knowledge_feedback_signals{signal_type="negative"}` / total |

### Intelligence Platform Notes

- **Knowledge maturity rate** is the key long-horizon signal. A platform that learns
  from every interaction should show a steadily rising crystallization throughput. Flat
  or declining throughput indicates the review queue is a bottleneck (see
  `axiom_knowledge_facts_pending_review` alert in [spec-observability.md §3](spec-observability.md)).
- **Correction rate** above 10% is both a quality alert and a training signal. D-FIB
  should surface it in `neut doctor`; it also feeds back into RAG corpus curation.
- **Prompt cache hit ratio** has a direct cost impact: cached input tokens are billed
  at a fraction of uncached tokens on most providers. The 60% target is achievable after
  a warm-up period once templates are stable.
- None of these metrics require changing user behaviour. All are derived from existing
  interaction log events and the feedback signals already flowing through the EVE pipeline.

3. Assignee manually reviews recent ops, runs simulations
4. Criticality data compiled into Word doc with bullet points
5. Word doc delivered via phone call to operators next morning
6. No SLA tracking, no visibility into process

### Ideal State (To-Be)

1. Hospital submits request via portal (or API integration)
2. System auto-checks reactor schedule availability
3. TRIGA DT generates simulation package automatically
4. Ops package delivered to operators digitally with checklist
5. Production tracked with SLA visibility
6. Post-production verification and delivery confirmation

## 10. Metrics Collection Infrastructure

For instrumentation, alerting, trace correlation, and the Prometheus/OTel collection
stack, see [spec-observability.md](spec-observability.md). The table below captures
the product-level collection gaps — what data is still missing to populate the metrics
in §1–§9.

| Gap | Current State | Required | Observability hook |
|-----|---------------|----------|--------------------|
| Pipeline observability | Cron logs only | Structured logging, alerting | `axiom_agent_runs_total` |
| User analytics | None | Web analytics (Plausible, PostHog) | Session/click tracking |
| Accuracy tracking | Manual spot checks | Automated comparison jobs → metrics DB | `axiom_rag_low_confidence_ratio` |
| User feedback | None | In-app feedback buttons (thumbs up/down) | `axiom_knowledge_feedback_signals` |
| Cost tracking | Unknown | TACC usage reports, monthly review | `axiom_llm_tokens_total` |
| Compliance audit coverage | Manual | `trace_id` on all log records | [spec-observability.md §4](spec-observability.md) |

## 11. Immediate Actions

1. **Instrument the pipeline** — Add `trace_id` to all structured log records (Phase 1 of [spec-observability.md §7](spec-observability.md))
2. **Add in-session feedback** — Deploy thumbs up/down to populate `axiom_knowledge_feedback_signals` and enable Correction Rate tracking
3. **Add web analytics** — Deploy lightweight analytics for adoption and session metrics
4. **Document current costs** — Get TACC billing data for infrastructure baseline
5. **Define "operating day"** — Agree on unit of measurement for pipeline completeness
6. **Run `neut doctor --metrics`** — Establish baseline against all alert thresholds in [spec-observability.md §3](spec-observability.md)
