# NeutronOS RAG Architecture Spec

**Status:** Active — Phase 1 schema migration pending
**Owner:** Ben Booth
**Created:** 2026-03-12
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-20 (updated: local DuckDB store, pack format, query fan-out, IAM dependency)
**Related:** `spec-model-routing.md`, `prd-agents.md`, `spec-rag-knowledge-maturity.md`, `spec-prompt-registry.md`, `adr-014-rag-tiered-local-cache.md`

## 1. Problem Statement

NeutronOS has a working RAG store (`src/neutron_os/rag/`) using pgvector. It has
two unresolved architectural gaps that become critical as the platform grows:

**Gap 1 — No scope model.**
The store's `tier` column conflates two independent concerns: content sensitivity
(`public | export_controlled`) and content scope (`community | facility | personal`).
Without separating these, it's impossible to build the per-user personalization that
makes Neut irreplaceable in daily use. This affects all deployments.

**Gap 2 — Cloud embedding of sensitive content (EC deployments only).**
`embeddings.py` always calls the OpenAI cloud API. For deployments handling
export-controlled documents (MCNP inputs, facility-specific procedures, licensed
simulation materials), this constitutes an unauthorized export of the content
itself — not just the query. Non-EC deployments are unaffected.

**Gap 2b — EC files cannot be copied to a user's local machine (EC deployments only).**
Under EAR and 10 CFR 810, the act of copying EC material off an authorized computing
environment is itself a transfer — even if the destination is a personal machine with
no external network access. EC documents must remain on authorized systems. This
invalidates any architecture that proposes "local embedding" of EC files on a user's
workstation. EC ingest, embedding, and storage must all run on the authorized system.

> **Current state:** The private server Rascal (a physical server at UT Austin running
> Qwen via Ollama) serves as the no-cloud environment for the **restricted** tier. A
> proper export-controlled / classified environment (TACC or equivalent) is a future
> design item and has not yet been built. The architecture is designed to accommodate
> it when ready. References to "authorized EC environment" throughout this spec describe
> the target design; Rascal represents the current restricted-tier implementation.

> **Non-EC deployments:** Single-store mode (local postgres) is the default. The
> restricted/EC store, private server connection, and dual-store retrieval are opt-in
> features activated only when a restricted-tier provider is configured. No
> configuration or infrastructure beyond local postgres and an embedding provider is
> required for standard operation.

---

## 2. Two-Dimensional Content Model

Every document in the RAG store has two independent attributes:

### 2.1 Access Tier (sensitivity axis)

| `access_tier` | Meaning | Embedding pipeline | Store location | Retrieval gate |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| `public` | Safe for cloud processing | Cloud (OpenAI, Anthropic) or local Ollama | Local postgres or cloud | Any authenticated user |
| `restricted` | No-cloud; private server only | Ollama on **private server** (e.g. Rascal running Qwen) — never cloud | Private server postgres (e.g. Rascal) | `restricted_access` role + VPN |
| `export_controlled` | EAR/10 CFR 810 regulated; classified/export-controlled material | Ollama on **authorized EC environment** (TACC — future, not yet built) — never cloud | Authorized EC environment postgres (TACC — future) | `export_controlled_access` role + VPN + authorized system |

> **Compliance note:** EC material cannot be copied to a user's workstation under any
> circumstances. All EC ingest, embedding, and storage must execute on an authorized
> system. Retrieval is proxied via VPN; only the LLM-synthesized response crosses the
> boundary.
>
> **Current implementation:** Rascal (private UT Austin server, running Qwen via Ollama)
> is the implementation of the **restricted** tier — it provides no-cloud LLM for
> sensitive-but-not-classified content. The `export_controlled` tier (TACC or equivalent
> authorized computing environment) is a future design item. The architecture separates
> these tiers by design so that TACC can be wired in when available without restructuring.

### 2.2 Scope (visibility axis)

| `scope` | Who can retrieve | Examples |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| `community` | Everyone (within their tier) | NRC regs, published papers, IAEA guides, reactor physics reference, neut docs |
| `facility` | Members of this facility | Facility procedures, local configs, facility meeting history |
| `personal` | Only the document owner | User notes, personal papers, individual session context |

### 2.3 The 2×3 Matrix

|  | `community` | `facility` | `personal` |
|--|------------|-----------|-----------|
| **`public`** | Shipped with Neut, curated nuclear knowledge base | Non-sensitive facility docs | User's public notes and papers |
| **`export_controlled`** | Licensed simulation docs (MCNP manuals, etc.) | EC facility procedures, sim configs | User's EC work files, run outputs |

---

## 2a. Three-Tier Corpus Architecture

The `scope` axis from §2.2 maps to three named corpora, each with a stable `corpus_id` used throughout the codebase and CLI:

| Corpus | `corpus_id` | `scope` | Content | Built when |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|------------|
| Community | `rag-community` | `community` | Pre-indexed nuclear domain knowledge (~33k chunks); ships bundled with the pip package | `neut setup` step 5a (`neut rag load-community`) |
| Organization | `rag-org` | `facility` | Facility-specific docs; synced from rascal/S3 by admin | `neut rag sync org` |
| Personal | `rag-internal` | `personal` | User's workspace: `docs/`, `runtime/knowledge/`, Python docstrings (via AST) | `neut rag index .` during install + post-push |

All three corpora are queried together on every retrieval call. When the same content exists in multiple corpora, personal results take priority over org, org over community.

### Priority and Conflict Resolution

```
rag-internal  (personal)    → highest priority — user's own workspace
rag-org       (facility)    → overrides community on facility-specific topics
rag-community (community)   → baseline nuclear domain knowledge
```

Priority is implemented at result-merging time: when two chunks have near-identical content (cosine similarity > 0.97) and different `corpus_id` values, the higher-priority corpus's chunk is returned and the lower-priority duplicate is suppressed.

---

## 3. Architecture

Two physically separate stores are required by export control compliance — not just
a logical separation. EC material cannot exist on a user's workstation.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Client["Client (user workstation)"]
        Q[User query]
        QC[Query classifier\nrouter.py]
        Q --> QC
    end

    subgraph PublicPath["Public path"]
        QC -->|public| QE1[Embed query\ncloud or local Ollama]
        QE1 --> S1["Public RAG store\nlocal postgres\naccess_tier=public"]
        S1 --> R1[Chunks → cloud LLM\nAnthropic]
    end

    subgraph ECPath["Restricted/EC path — VPN required"]
        QC -->|restricted or\nexport_controlled| VPN[VPN tunnel\nUT network]
        VPN --> RAPI["Retrieval API\non private server\n(Rascal today;\nTACC for classified)"]
        RAPI --> S2["Restricted RAG store\nprivate server postgres\naccess_tier=restricted\n(or export_controlled\nwhen TACC is built)"]
        S2 --> LLM2["Qwen on private server\n(Rascal today;\nTACC LLM for classified)"]
        LLM2 --> Resp[Response only\ncrosses VPN boundary]
    end

    subgraph PrivateIngest["Restricted Ingest — private server only"]
        ED[Restricted/EC Document\non private server]
        OL[Ollama on private server\nnomic-embed-text]
        ED --> OL --> S2
    end
```

**Key invariants:**

1. **Restricted/EC text never touches a cloud API** and **never leaves the private/authorized
   environment.** Under EAR/10 CFR 810, copying EC material to a client workstation is itself
   an unauthorized transfer. All restricted/EC ingest, embedding, storage, and retrieval happen
   on the private server (Rascal for the restricted tier today; TACC for the classified/EC tier
   when built).
2. **Two physical stores, same logical schema.** Both run pgvector with identical
   `access_tier`/`scope` columns. The public store is local; the restricted/EC store is on the
   private server. The client connects to each via different connection strings.
3. **Query embedding must match document embedding.** Public queries embed on cloud/local
   and search the local store. Restricted/EC queries embed on the private server and search the
   private server store.
4. **Only the synthesized response crosses the VPN boundary.** The private-server LLM (Qwen on
   Rascal) runs server-side; its text output returns to the client. Retrieved restricted/EC
   chunks are consumed server-side. Whether chunk text appears in the response is a facility
   policy decision (redaction scope).
5. **Personal restricted/EC content follows the same rule.** A user's restricted or EC work
   files must be indexed on the private server, not on their local machine, even if they
   authored the files.

---

## 3a. Local Store (DuckDB)

The local store is a DuckDB database with the `vss` extension for vector similarity
search. It lives at `~/.neut/rag/local.duckdb` (or `$NEUT_HOME/rag/local.duckdb`).
It holds:

- **`rag-internal` corpus:** always synced here first; this IS the primary store for
  personal content.
- **`rag-org` pack cache:** chunks loaded from downloaded `.neutpack` files; never
  written by ingestion directly.

### Schema (DuckDB)

```sql
CREATE TABLE chunks (
    id           UUID        PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    doc_path     TEXT        NOT NULL,
    chunk_index  INT         NOT NULL,
    text         TEXT        NOT NULL,
    corpus       TEXT        NOT NULL,  -- rag-internal | rag-org
    pack_id      TEXT,                  -- NULL for rag-internal; pack version for rag-org
    checksum     TEXT,
    indexed_at   TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    embedding    FLOAT[768]             -- NULL if no embedding model available
);

CREATE INDEX ON chunks (corpus, doc_path);
-- vss index created post-load when embeddings present:
-- CALL vss.create_index('chunks', 'embedding');
```

Pack manifest table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE installed_packs (
    pack_id      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    domain_tag   TEXT NOT NULL,
    version      TEXT NOT NULL,
    installed_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    fact_count   INT,
    sha256       TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

The DuckDB local store is the default for all personal content and pack cache. It
requires no PostgreSQL instance and works fully offline. The server-side PostgreSQL
store (§4) is additive — used for community corpus, restricted/EC content, and
(eventually) IAM-gated server-side sync.

---

## 3b. Query Fan-out

At query time the RAG retriever fans out across available stores:

```
User query
    │
    ├── Local DuckDB (always) ──────────────────→ local_results
    │   [rag-internal + installed rag-org packs]
    │
    ├── Remote PostgreSQL (if reachable) ────────→ remote_results
    │   [full rag-org + rag-community]
    │
    └── TACC endpoint (if routing_tier=export_controlled) → ec_results
        [rag-export-controlled, identity-gated]

    Merge by relevance score → top-k chunks → inject into prompt
```

If remote is unreachable: local results only. Graceful degradation, never a hard
failure.

The merge step applies corpus priority as defined in §2a: `rag-internal` results
score highest when content is near-duplicate across corpora, then `rag-org`, then
`rag-community`. Score merging is done at result time — no cross-store joins required.

---

## 3c. Pack Format (.neutpack)

A `.neutpack` file is a gzip-compressed tar containing:

- `manifest.json` — pack metadata (matches community spec §7.4)
- `chunks.parquet` — pre-chunked, pre-embedded content
- `SHA256SUMS` — integrity verification

Install: `neut rag pack install <file.neutpack>` loads chunks into local DuckDB and
records in `installed_packs`.

```bash
neut rag pack install ./nuclear-regs-v2.neutpack   # load pack into local DuckDB
neut rag pack list                                  # list installed packs with chunk counts
neut rag pack remove <pack_id>                      # unload pack and delete from local store
```

The pack format enables offline distribution of org corpus snapshots without requiring
a running server or admin credentials. A facility admin exports a pack; users install it
locally. Packs are read-only at query time — user ingestion never writes to the pack
cache rows; it only writes to `rag-internal`.

---

## 3d. IAM Dependency

The following capabilities require IAM and are deferred:

| Capability | IAM requirement |
|---|---|
| Automatic `rag-internal` sync to server-side user account | Per-user identity + namespace |
| Pack entitlement checks | Authorization service: which packs a user may download |
| Per-user namespacing in server-side PostgreSQL | User account provisioning |
| TACC access gating | Network + identity (both required) |

Until IAM ships:

- `rag-internal` is **local-only** (no automatic sync)
- Manual portability: `neut rag export --personal` / `neut rag import --personal <file>`
- Packs are downloaded without entitlement enforcement (honor system)
- TACC access is controlled by network reachability + API key only

This means Phase 0 (see §12) can ship and deliver value independently of IAM
infrastructure. No IAM plumbing is needed to use local DuckDB, install packs, or
run the query fan-out against a reachable remote.

---

## 4. Schema Evolution

### Current schema (existing)

```sql
-- chunks table has:
tier    TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'institutional'   -- ambiguous; being repurposed
owner   TEXT                                    -- personal scope marker
```

### Target schema

```sql
ALTER TABLE chunks
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS access_tier TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'public',
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS scope       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'community';

ALTER TABLE documents
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS access_tier TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'public',
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS scope       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'community';

-- Migrate existing 'institutional' tier → 'public' access_tier, 'community' scope
UPDATE chunks SET access_tier = 'public', scope = 'community' WHERE tier = 'institutional';
UPDATE documents SET access_tier = 'public', scope = 'community' WHERE tier = 'institutional';

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_chunks_access_tier ON chunks (access_tier);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_chunks_scope ON chunks (scope);
```

The legacy `tier` column is kept for a transition period, then dropped.

---

## 5. Embedding Provider Abstraction

`src/neutron_os/rag/embeddings.py` evolves from a single cloud function to a
provider-aware interface:

```python
def embed_texts(
    texts: list[str],
    access_tier: str = "public",          # routes to cloud or local
    model: str | None = None,             # override; None = use default for tier
) -> list[list[float]] | None:
    """Embed texts using the appropriate provider for the access tier.

    public           → cloud API (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
    export_controlled → local Ollama (nomic-embed-text or configured model)
    """
```

**Restricted-tier embedding provider (Ollama on private server, e.g. Rascal):**
- Runs on the private server — never on the user's workstation or a cloud API
- Model: `nomic-embed-text` (768 dims) or `mxbai-embed-large` (1024 dims)
- The same Ollama instance used by `OllamaClassifier` for restricted/EC query classification
- Ingest pipeline for restricted content runs as a server-side job on the private server (not a client CLI command)

> **Note:** Rascal is the current implementation of the restricted tier (private UT Austin
> server, running Qwen). The classified/export-controlled tier would use TACC as the
> authorized computing environment — TACC integration is a future design item. When TACC
> is available, a separate embedding provider entry pointing to the TACC Ollama instance
> handles the `export_controlled` tier.

**Compliance boundary (current: Rascal for restricted tier):**
```
client workstation          UT VPN / private server (Rascal)
──────────────────          ────────────────────────────────────────────────
neut chat                   restricted document files
query → router              Ollama (nomic-embed-text)
                            pgvector restricted store
                  ←VPN←    Qwen on Rascal
synthesized response        (LLM runs here; response crosses VPN boundary)

                            [Future: TACC for export_controlled tier]
```

**Dimension note:** EC store uses 768-dim vectors (Ollama); public store uses 1536-dim (OpenAI)
or 768-dim (local Ollama for public content). Stores are physically separate, so mixed
dimensions across stores are not a problem. Each store's index is internally consistent.

---

## 6. Community Corpus (`rag-community`)

The community corpus is the differentiator that makes onboarding immediately valuable.
It ships pre-indexed as a bundled artifact and is loaded during `neut setup`.

### 6.1 Content (v1 — ~33,000 chunks)

| Category | Documents | `access_tier` |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| NRC regulations | 10 CFR Parts 50, 830 | `public` |
| DOE standards | DOE-STD-1066, DOE-STD-3009 | `public` |
| IAEA safety reports | Selected series | `public` |
| Simulation codes | MCNP6 user manual, SCALE overview, ORIGEN chain docs | `public` |
| V&V | ASME V&V 10 | `public` |
| Neut documentation | All of `docs/` in this repo | `public` |

No export-controlled content is included in the bundled community corpus. Licensed code manuals (MCNP with LANL license, etc.) are facility-provided and indexed separately into `rag-org`.

### 6.2 Distribution

The community corpus ships as a compressed PostgreSQL dump bundled inside the pip package:

```
src/neutron_os/data/rag/community-v1.pgdump.gz
```

The dump contains the `rag_community` schema with pre-embedded vectors. Loading it does not require re-embedding — the dump restores directly into the local PostgreSQL instance.

```bash
neut rag load-community          # decompress + pg_restore into rag_community schema (~30s)
```

This command is called automatically during `neut setup` step 5a. It is safe to re-run; on re-load the old schema is renamed to `rag_community_prev` before the new load (enabling one-version rollback).

### 6.3 Versioning and Upgrade

The community corpus is versioned with Neut releases. `neut update` checks whether the installed corpus version matches the package version and loads a newer dump if available.

Upgrade path:

```sql
-- Before loading new community dump:
ALTER SCHEMA rag_community RENAME TO rag_community_prev;
-- pg_restore into new rag_community schema
-- After validation:
DROP SCHEMA rag_community_prev CASCADE;   -- manual cleanup after confirming upgrade
```

One previous version is retained to allow rollback. Two-version-old schemas are dropped automatically on the next upgrade.

### 6.4 Deployment Roadmap

The bundled pgdump approach (v1) supersedes the earlier rascal rsync strategy. Future phases add delta sync and CDN delivery but maintain the same `neut rag load-community` interface.

| Phase | Mechanism | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **v1 — bundled pgdump** | Ships in pip package; `neut rag load-community` | ~30s restore, no network needed |
| **v2 — rascal snapshot** | Manual `rsync` + `neut rag index` for non-bundled content | VPN required |
| **v3 — S3** | `neut rag sync community` auto-downloads versioned artifact | AWS approval pending |
| **v4 — CDN** | Hosted artifact, delta sync, checksummed | Long-term |

### 6.5 Out-of-Box Experience

First `neut chat` after install:
```
Community knowledge base loaded (33,000 chunks)
   Topics: NRC regs, DOE standards, IAEA reports, MCNP6, SCALE, Neut docs
   Org knowledge: not configured (run: neut rag sync org)
   Personal knowledge: not indexed (run: neut rag index . to add your workspace)
```

---

## 6b. Organization Corpus (`rag-org`)

The org corpus contains facility-specific documents maintained by an admin. It maps to `scope = 'facility'` and is visible to all authenticated members of the facility.

**Content:** Facility procedures, local configurations, licensed code manuals, facility meeting history, site-specific regulatory correspondence.

**Sync sources (roadmap):**

| Phase | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| v1 | Manual: `neut rag sync org --source rascal` — rsync from rascal mountpoint |
| v3 | `neut rag sync org --source s3` — S3 bucket configured by admin |
| v4 | CDN-hosted org snapshot with delta sync |

```bash
neut rag sync org                # pull latest org corpus snapshot (source from config)
neut rag sync org --source rascal:/neut/org-rag/  # explicit source override
```

Admin configures the org sync source in `runtime/config/secrets.toml`:
```toml
[rag.org]
sync_source = "rascal:/neut/org-rag/"   # or s3://bucket/path/
```

The org corpus is indexed into `rag_org` schema in the local PostgreSQL instance for public-access_tier content, and into the private server PostgreSQL instance (Rascal today) for restricted-tier facility documents.

---

## 7. Personal RAG (Onboarding Augmentation)

During `neut config` (setup wizard), the user is offered:

```
Would you like Neut to index your documents for personalized retrieval?
Neut will index public documents you specify — your notes, papers, non-sensitive files.

  Public documents (notes, papers, non-sensitive files):
    Indexed locally on this machine. Never sent to cloud APIs.

  Restricted documents (MCNP inputs, sim configs, licensed materials):
    Must remain on the private server (Rascal/VPN environment).
    Indexing runs server-side via `neut rag index --remote`.
    You access them only while connected to UT VPN.

  [Y] Yes, index my public documents now
  [e] Set up restricted-tier indexing on private server (requires VPN)
  [n] Skip for now
```

### 7.1 Compliance Boundary for Personal RAG

EC files created or used by an individual must still stay in the authorized environment.
If a user has MCNP input files on their workstation, they are in violation of handling
requirements — that's a facility policy issue, not a Neut design issue. Neut will not
offer to index files on the local machine as export-controlled. Instead:

```
User: "I have MCNP inputs I want to index"
Neut: "Restricted files must be indexed from the private server.
       Copy them to the private server (e.g. Rascal) first,
       then run: neut rag index --remote <path>"
```

### 7.2 Ingest Commands

```bash
# Public personal documents (indexed locally)
neut rag index ./my-notes/                          # auto-classify; public only
neut rag index ./facility-procedures/ --scope facility  # facility-wide visibility

# Restricted documents (indexed on private server via VPN — e.g. Rascal)
neut rag index --remote rascal:/home/user/mcnp-inputs/  # runs server-side on private server
neut rag index --remote rascal:/home/user/sim-configs/ --tier restricted

neut rag status                                     # show index stats (both stores)
neut rag list                                       # list indexed documents
neut rag remove ./old-notes/                        # remove from public index
```

### 7.2 Auto-Classification During Ingest

When `--tier` is not specified, the export control router classifies each document
before embedding:

```python
# ingest.py
tier = router.classify(content[:2000]).tier.value  # sample first 2000 chars
embeddings = embed_texts(chunks, access_tier=tier)
```

User is shown what was classified and may override before committing.

### 7.3 Personal Corpus Sources (Implemented)

The personal corpus (`rag-internal`) is built automatically from four source types.
All ingest is **fully asynchronous** — no blocking in the prompt/response chain.

| Source | Path | Trigger | `source_type` |
|--------|------|---------|--------------|
| Chat session transcripts | `runtime/sessions/*.json` | After every chat turn (daemon thread) | `session` |
| Processed signal outputs | `runtime/inbox/processed/*.json` | `neut rag index` / watch | `signal` |
| Git commit logs | `.git` repos under `runtime/knowledge/` | `neut rag index` / watch | `git-log` |
| Daily notes | `runtime/knowledge/notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | `neut note "..."` (immediate, background) | `markdown` |

**Session indexing** — `ChatAgent._schedule_session_index()` spawns a `daemon=True`
thread after each completed turn. Checksum deduplication means unchanged turns cost
nothing on re-runs. Sessions with fewer than 3 turns are skipped as noise.

**Watch mode** — `neut rag watch` runs a `watchdog` filesystem observer across
`docs/`, `runtime/knowledge/`, `runtime/sessions/`, and `runtime/inbox/processed/`.
Events are debounced (2 s window) to handle editor temp-file swaps.

**Notes** — `neut note "thought"` appends a timestamped entry to the daily markdown
file and triggers background re-indexing. `neut note` (bare) opens `$EDITOR`.

**Low-confidence hint** — when the best `combined_score < 0.15`, the system prompt
appends: `[Low RAG confidence — run neut rag index or neut note to add more context]`

**Implementation** — `src/neutron_os/rag/personal.py` contains `ingest_sessions()`,
`ingest_signals()`, `ingest_git_logs()`. `ingest_repo()` calls all three when
`personal=True` (default for `rag-internal`; set `False` for community/org corpora).

### 7.4 Corpus Lifecycle — M-O Stewardship

The personal corpus grows without bound unless actively managed. M-O owns corpus
health as a scheduled stewardship task, analogous to how it manages `archive/` and
`spikes/`.

**M-O responsibilities:**

| Task | Schedule | Command |
|------|----------|---------|
| Nightly incremental index | Daily, off-hours | `neut rag index` (checksum-skipping, fast) |
| Session pruning | Weekly | Delete `sessions/` corpus entries older than N days (configurable `rag.session_ttl_days`) |
| Corpus health check | On `neut status` | Detect source/index drift; report stale document count |
| Watch daemon supervision | On login | Start `neut rag watch`; restart on crash (launchd/systemd) |
| Index size reporting | On `neut status` | Surface chunk counts without requiring `neut rag status` |

**Watch daemon installation** — during `neut config`, M-O generates and installs:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.neutronos.rag-watch.plist` (launchd)
- **Linux**: `~/.config/systemd/user/neutron-os-rag-watch.service` (systemd user unit)

Both supervise `neut rag watch --quiet` and restart on exit.

**Session TTL** — configurable via:
```bash
neut settings set rag.session_ttl_days 90   # default: 90
```
M-O's weekly sweep calls `store.delete_corpus_older_than(CORPUS_INTERNAL, days=ttl)`
(to be implemented in `rag/store.py`).

*Cross-reference: `spec-agent-architecture.md` §M-O Corpus Stewardship*

### 7.5 What Makes Neut Irreplaceable

The personal RAG compounds over time. After 6 months of use:
- Every meeting the user attended is indexed and retrievable
- Every document they ingested is searchable
- Every chat session is retrospectively searchable
- Community content is always fresh (auto-updated)
- Facility context (procedures, configs) is mixed in automatically

A query like "what's the last time we discussed xenon poisoning in a meeting?" or
"find me the relevant NRC reg for this operating limit" works across all three scopes

## 7b. `neut rag` CLI Reference

All RAG operations go through the `neut rag` noun. Commands that write to the database require a configured `rag.database_url`.

```bash
# ─── Corpus loading ───────────────────────────────────────────────
neut rag load-community          # decompress + pg_restore bundled community dump (~30s)
                                 # called automatically by neut setup step 5a

neut rag sync org                # pull org corpus snapshot (source from config)
neut rag sync org --source <url> # explicit source: rascal:/path or s3://bucket/path

# ─── Personal corpus ──────────────────────────────────────────────
neut rag index [path]            # index path into rag-internal; includes sessions,
                                 # signals, git logs, and notes automatically
neut rag index --remote <path>   # server-side index for EC content on rascal
neut rag watch                   # foreground watcher: re-indexes changed files live
                                 # (M-O installs this as a launchd/systemd daemon)

# ─── Notes (personal knowledge capture) ────────────────────────────
neut note "quick thought"        # append timestamped note to today's daily file,
                                 # index in background (zero prompt-chain impact)
neut note                        # open $EDITOR for longer note, then index
neut note --list                 # show recent daily note files

# ─── Search and inspection ────────────────────────────────────────
neut rag search <query>          # hybrid search across all three corpora
neut rag status                  # chunk counts per corpus (rag-community / rag-org / rag-internal)
neut rag list                    # list indexed documents with corpus, scope, tier
neut rag remove <path>           # remove path from rag-internal index

# ─── Maintenance (M-O scheduled) ──────────────────────────────────
neut rag reindex                 # clear corpus and rebuild from all sources
neut rag reindex --corpus rag-internal --model <model>  # re-embed with new model
```

`neut rag status` output example:

```
corpus          scope       chunks   last_updated
rag-community   community   33,241   2026-03-10 (v1.2.0)
rag-org         facility     4,108   2026-03-11
rag-internal    personal     1,834   2026-03-13
```

## 8. Export Control Compliance Requirements

> This section captures compliance constraints that MUST be enforced by design.
> These are not aspirational — they are hard architectural requirements.

### 8.1 What the Regulations Require

| Regulation | Requirement | Neut implication |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| EAR (15 CFR 730-774) | Controlled technology may not be released to unauthorized persons or locations | EC documents cannot be copied to a user's workstation; cannot transit cloud APIs |
| 10 CFR 810 | Unclassified nuclear technology requires DOE authorization for transfer | Same as EAR for nuclear-specific codes (MCNP, ORIGEN, etc.) |
| Facility license | Facility-specific SLAs with LANL/ORNL/etc. for licensed code manuals | Manuals must stay in controlled environment per license terms |

### 8.2 Prohibited Operations (by design)

The following operations MUST be prevented by the architecture — not just policy:

| Operation | Why prohibited | Design control |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| `neut rag index ./mcnp-inputs/` (local) | Copies restricted/EC file content to local postgres | Router classifies → `--remote` flag required for restricted/EC |
| Sending restricted/EC chunk text to cloud LLM | Transmits restricted/EC content to unauthorized service | Restricted/EC queries only reach private server LLM on VPN |
| Downloading restricted/EC chunks to display in terminal | Retrieved restricted/EC text on client workstation | Facility policy decision; Neut default: display only LLM-synthesized response |
| Restricted/EC embedding via OpenAI API | Transmits restricted/EC content to cloud | Restricted/EC embedding runs on private server Ollama only |

### 8.3 Authorized Restricted/EC Data Flow

```
1. Restricted/EC document exists on private server (Rascal for restricted;
   TACC for export_controlled — future)
2. Ingest job runs on private server:
   classify → embed (Ollama on private server) → store (private server postgres)
3. User connects via UT VPN
4. User query classified as restricted/EC by router.py
5. Query embedding computed on private server (via retrieval API)
6. Similarity search on private server postgres
7. Top chunks fed to LLM on private server (Qwen on Rascal today)
8. LLM generates response — only the response crosses VPN boundary
9. Response displayed to user

Note: Steps 1–8 all execute on the private server. The only data that
crosses the VPN is the synthesized text response in step 9.
Classified (export_controlled) content would follow the same flow on TACC
once that environment is built.
```

### 8.4 Open Policy Questions (facility must decide)

These require facility radiation protection / export control officer input:

1. **Are retrieved EC chunk texts considered a controlled transfer?**
   If yes: only synthesized LLM responses may cross the VPN (default Neut behavior).
   If no: raw chunk text may be returned to the client for display (more useful, riskier).

2. **Does the classification of the synthesized response need to be marked?**
   If the LLM synthesizes a response that substantially reproduces EC content, does
   that response inherit an EC classification? Current approach: mark responses from
   the EC retrieval path with `[Export-Controlled Environment]` prefix.

3. **Can researchers index their restricted work files from the private server home directories?**
   Yes — they're already on the private server (Rascal). `neut rag index --remote` triggers
   a server-side job. Authentication is via existing SSH key / private server credentials.
   For genuinely classified/EC content, the same principle applies on TACC when that
   environment is available.

### 8.5 Prompt Injection Defense

RAG-augmented systems are vulnerable to prompt injection via malicious content in indexed
documents. For restricted/EC RAG, this is also an exfiltration vector — a poisoned document
on the private server could instruct the LLM to reproduce controlled content in its response.

Defense layers:
1. **Chunk sanitization** — strip known injection patterns before LLM injection (server-side on private server)
2. **System prompt hardening** — explicit instructions in the private server LLM (Qwen) system prompt prohibiting instruction-following from retrieved content
3. **Response scanning** — scan private server LLM output for restricted/EC keyword matches before returning to client
4. **Audit log** — every restricted/EC session logs query hash, response hash, chunk source paths (no plaintext)

Full threat model, attack vectors, and implementation detail:
*Cross-reference: `spec-model-routing.md` §8 (Prompt Injection & EC Exfiltration Defense)*

---

## 9. Retrieval Query Design

The client queries two separate stores depending on routing tier:

```python
# Public store — local postgres, direct connection
public_store = RAGStore(settings.get("rag.database_url"))

# Restricted/EC store — private server postgres (Rascal today), VPN required
ec_store = RAGStore(settings.get("rag.ec_database_url"))  # e.g., postgresql://rascal.utexas.edu:5432/neutron_os_restricted
```

```python
def search(
    query_embedding: list[float] | None,
    query_text: str,
    access_tiers: list[str],          # from user auth: ["public"] or ["public", "export_controlled"]
    scopes: list[str] = ("community", "facility", "personal"),
    owner: str | None = None,         # user ID for personal scope filtering
    limit: int = 10,
) -> list[SearchResult]:
```

The WHERE clause (same SQL, different physical store):
```sql
WHERE access_tier = ANY(%(access_tiers)s)
  AND (
      scope = 'community'
      OR scope = 'facility'
      OR (scope = 'personal' AND owner = %(owner)s)
  )
```

Personal scope chunks are only returned when `owner` matches — no cross-user leakage.

`corpus_id` to `scope` mapping for the three-tier architecture:

| `corpus_id` | `scope` value in WHERE | Writable via |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| `rag-community` | `'community'` | `neut rag load-community` only (read-only at query time) |
| `rag-org` | `'facility'` | `neut rag sync org` (admin) |
| `rag-internal` | `'personal'` | `neut rag index` (user) |

`rag-community` is a read-only corpus at query time. No user-facing `neut rag index` command writes to `scope = 'community'`. Community corpus updates come exclusively from `load-community` (which restores a versioned dump).

Add `rag.ec_database_url` to settings defaults (empty = EC RAG disabled):
```
neut settings set rag.ec_database_url "postgresql://rascal.utexas.edu:5432/neutron_os_ec"
```

---

## 10. Model-Agnostic Embedding

Embedding providers are declared in `models.toml` using the same provider pattern as
chat models, with `use_for = ["embedding"]`. The gateway selects the right provider
by task + routing tier — no code changes needed when switching embedding models.

```toml
[[gateway.providers]]
name         = "openai-embed"
endpoint     = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
model        = "text-embedding-3-small"
api_key_env  = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
use_for      = ["embedding"]
routing_tier = "public"
dims         = 1536

[[gateway.providers]]
name         = "nomic-local"
endpoint     = "http://localhost:11434"   # Ollama
model        = "nomic-embed-text"
use_for      = ["embedding"]
routing_tier = "export_controlled"        # used for EC content only
dims         = 768
```

`embed_texts(texts, access_tier)` calls `gateway._select_provider("embedding", access_tier)`,
so swapping the embedding model is a `models.toml` change — no Python changes needed.

**Routing profiles (v0.5.0):** Embedding providers will be selected via
routing profiles rather than flat `use_for` tags. See
[Model Routing Spec §10](spec-model-routing.md) for the design.

```toml
[routing_profiles.embedding]
providers = ["openai-embed", "ollama-embed"]
on_all_fail = "skip"            # Fall back to keyword search

[routing_profiles.ec_embedding]
providers = ["ollama-rascal"]   # Never cloud
on_all_fail = "error"           # EC content must be embedded locally
cloud_allowed = false
```

Each RAG corpus declares which embedding profile to use, ensuring EC
content is never sent to a cloud embedding API.

### 9.1 The Dimension Problem

Vector dimensions are fixed at index time. Mixing providers (e.g., 1536-dim public +
768-dim EC) means cross-tier similarity search is not meaningful — which is correct
behavior (EC queries should not retrieve public-embedded chunks with an EC query vector).

**Per-chunk dimension tracking:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE chunks ADD COLUMN embedding_model TEXT;   -- e.g., "text-embedding-3-small"
ALTER TABLE chunks ADD COLUMN embedding_dims  INT;    -- e.g., 1536
```

Query embedding must use the same `embedding_model` as the chunks being searched.
The retrieval layer reads the active embedding provider for the target `access_tier`
and embeds the query with the matching model.

**Re-indexing on model change:**

```bash
neut rag reindex --tier public --model text-embedding-3-large   # upgrade public embeddings
neut rag reindex --tier export_controlled                       # re-embed EC with current model
```

Only the `embedding` column changes; chunk text and metadata are preserved.

---

## 11. Intersection with Auth & Export Control Routing

The RAG access tier, LLM routing tier, and physical store location must all be consistent.
A restricted/EC query must use the private server LLM *and* the private server RAG store —
neither can be substituted without breaking the compliance boundary.

| User auth state | LLM routing | RAG retrieval | Physical store |
|-----------------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| No `restricted` / `export_controlled` role | `public` providers only | `access_tier = public` only | Local postgres |
| Has role, VPN connected | Both tiers | Both tiers | Local (public) + private server (restricted/EC) |
| Has role, VPN down | Public only + warning | Public only + warning | Local postgres only |

When a query routes to the restricted/EC tier (Qwen on Rascal today), the RAG retrieval
searches `rag.ec_database_url` (private server postgres), not the local store. The query
embedding is also computed on the private server. The entire restricted/EC retrieval +
generation loop stays server-side.

*Cross-reference: `spec-model-routing.md` §7 (Auth intersection).*

## 13. promptfoo Eval Harness

NeutronOS uses [promptfoo](https://promptfoo.dev) (MIT open-source) to evaluate RAG quality.
Configs live in `tests/promptfoo/`.

> **Note:** OpenAI acquired promptfoo on 2026-03-09. The MIT-licensed core continues and
> is what we use. Monitor for vendor lock-in; if necessary, fork or migrate.

### 12.1 Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tests/promptfoo/promptfooconfig.yaml` | Chat agent quality + hallucination tests |
| `tests/promptfoo/rag-evals.yaml` | RAG retrieval relevance + grounding tests |
| `tests/promptfoo/redteam-export-control.yaml` | Adversarial EC safety sweep |
| `tests/promptfoo/rag_provider.py` | Python provider: calls `RAGStore.search()` → injects `{{RAG_CONTEXT}}` |

### 12.2 RAG Python Provider

`rag_provider.py` is a promptfoo Python provider that:
1. Accepts a `query` from test `vars`
2. Calls `RAGStore.search()` with appropriate `tier` and `scope`
3. Returns the retrieved chunks as `{{RAG_CONTEXT}}`
4. The downstream LLM provider uses `{{RAG_CONTEXT}}` in its system prompt

This lets promptfoo evaluate whether the LLM answer is grounded in *actually retrieved* content,
not just parametric knowledge.

### 12.3 Running Evals

```bash
cd tests/promptfoo

# Chat quality tests (uses Ollama judge — no API cost)
npx promptfoo eval -c promptfooconfig.yaml

# RAG retrieval + grounding tests (requires running PostgreSQL + RAG indexed)
npx promptfoo eval -c rag-evals.yaml

# Adversarial EC safety sweep (generates attack variants, tests refusals)
npx promptfoo redteam run -c redteam-export-control.yaml

# View results dashboard
npx promptfoo view
```

### 12.4 CI Integration

Add to the pre-push hook or CI pipeline:
```bash
# Fast chat quality check (Ollama judge, no API cost, ~60s)
npx promptfoo eval -c tests/promptfoo/promptfooconfig.yaml --ci
```

promptfoo returns exit code 1 if any assertions fail — compatible with standard CI gates.
Use `--cache` to avoid re-running identical prompts in repeated CI runs.

## 14. Agentic RAG

The sections above describe single-pass retrieval: receive query → embed → search →
inject chunks → generate. This section adds agentic (multi-step) retrieval, where the
system plans the query, evaluates the retrieved context, and decides whether to act or
fetch more before generating.

*Cross-reference: `spec-rag-knowledge-maturity.md` (interaction log schema and knowledge
maturity pipeline), `spec-prompt-registry.md` (prompt templates).*

### 14.1 What is Agentic RAG

**Single-pass RAG (current model):** receive query → embed → search → inject chunks →
generate. The agent has no opportunity to assess whether the retrieved context is
sufficient before generating.

**Agentic RAG** adds deliberation:

1. **Plan** — before retrieval, determine whether retrieval is needed and how to
   formulate the query.
2. **Retrieve** — execute the retrieval as planned.
3. **Evaluate** — assess whether the retrieved context is sufficient to answer accurately.
4. **Iterate** — if insufficient and a followup query is available, retrieve again
   (up to a configured maximum).
5. **Generate** — produce the response with the best available context.

This reduces hallucination on queries where initial retrieval is poor, and eliminates
unnecessary retrieval overhead for queries that don't need it (greetings, arithmetic,
clarification).

### 14.2 Query Planner

Before retrieval, a lightweight planning step determines:

- **Is retrieval necessary?** Greetings, arithmetic, simple clarification questions do
  not need retrieval.
- **Which tier(s) to search?** `public` only, or also `restricted`/`classified` if the
  user is authorized. (NeutronOS configures these as `public`, `restricted`,
  `export_controlled`.)
- **Which scope(s)?** `community` baseline always; add `facility` if the query is
  facility-specific; add `personal` if the query references personal context.
- **What query reformulation would improve recall?** Expand acronyms, add synonyms,
  decompose compound queries.

```python
@dataclass
class RetrievalPlan:
    needs_retrieval: bool
    query_text: str                  # possibly reformulated
    tiers: list[str]
    scopes: list[str]
    max_chunks: int
    rationale: str                   # logged for observability
```

**v1 — heuristic rules (configurable):**

- Skip retrieval if: `query_length < 15` chars, or query matches greeting/arithmetic patterns.
- Search classified tier only if: user has classified access AND query matches classified
  keyword signals.
- Include personal scope if: query contains first-person pronouns or references "my",
  "our", "I".

**v2 — LLM planner:** a small LLM call (cheapest available provider) that returns a
`RetrievalPlan` as structured JSON. See Phase 6 in §12.

### 14.3 Context Evaluator

After retrieval, before generation, evaluate whether the retrieved context is sufficient:

```python
@dataclass
class ContextEvaluation:
    sufficient: bool
    confidence: float           # 0.0–1.0
    missing_aspects: list[str]  # what's not covered
    suggested_followup_query: str | None
```

**v1 — heuristic:** `sufficient = best_score > 0.4 AND len(chunks) >= 3`

**v2 — LLM evaluator:** "Given this query and these retrieved chunks, is the context
sufficient to answer accurately? If not, what is missing?"

If `sufficient = False` and `suggested_followup_query` is not `None`: execute a second
retrieval with the followup query, merge results, re-evaluate. **Maximum 2 iterations**
to prevent runaway loops.

### 14.4 Agentic RAG Loop

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Q[User query] --> P[Query Planner]
    P -->|needs_retrieval = false| G[Generate directly]
    P -->|needs_retrieval = true| R1[Retrieve — pass 1]
    R1 --> E1[Context Evaluator]
    E1 -->|sufficient| G
    E1 -->|insufficient, iteration < 2| R2[Retrieve — pass 2\nwith followup query]
    R2 --> E2[Context Evaluator]
    E2 --> G
    G --> S[_scan_response] --> IL[Write interaction_log]
    IL --> Resp[Response to user]
```

### 14.5 Interaction Log Integration

Each agentic RAG loop writes one `interaction_log` record (see
`spec-rag-knowledge-maturity.md`). The `chunks_retrieved` field captures all chunks
from all passes. The `rationale` from the `RetrievalPlan` is stored in a new
`retrieval_plan` JSONB column added to the `interaction_log` table.

### 14.6 Configuration

```toml
[rag.agentic]
enabled              = true
max_retrieval_passes = 2
planner_mode         = "heuristic"   # heuristic | llm (v2)
evaluator_mode       = "heuristic"   # heuristic | llm (v2)
evaluator_threshold  = 0.4           # min best_score to consider context sufficient
```

### 14.7 EC Compliance in Agentic RAG

The query planner and context evaluator themselves must not see export-controlled
content — they run on the client side with public-tier context only. Retrieval steps
are tier-gated as in the single-pass model.

The followup query (generated by the context evaluator) is derived from the evaluator's
assessment of the public-tier context, not from EC chunks. If the user has restricted/classified
access, a separate restricted/EC retrieval pass runs on the private server (Rascal today;
TACC for classified content when available) as before — the planner and evaluator have no
visibility into that path.

---

## 15. Prompt Caching

### 15.1 Why Prompt Caching Matters

Static prompt blocks — system preambles, persona definitions, tool descriptions,
few-shot examples — are re-sent on every completion request but rarely change between
turns or even between sessions. Anthropic supports `cache_control: {type: "ephemeral"}`
on message blocks, caching them server-side for up to 5 minutes. For active users and
agentic RAG loops (which may make multiple LLM calls per user query), this is a
material cost and latency reduction.

### 15.2 What Gets Cached

| Block | Static? | Cache? |
|-------|---------|--------|
| EC hardened preamble | Yes | Yes — template `ec_hardened_preamble`, `cache_hint = true` |
| Agent persona system prompt | Yes | Yes — each agent's persona template |
| Tool descriptions | Yes (per session) | Yes |
| Few-shot examples | Yes (per template version) | Yes |
| RAG context (retrieved chunks) | No — changes per query | No |
| User message | No | No |

### 15.3 Message Ordering for Cache Efficiency

Anthropic's cache activates only when cached blocks appear before uncached blocks in
the message array. The gateway orders message blocks as follows:

```
[cached system blocks]
→ [cached few-shot examples]
→ [dynamic RAG context]
→ [user message]
```

This ordering maximises cache hits even as the dynamic RAG context and user message
change on every turn.

### 15.4 Implementation

Prompt caching is handled via the Prompt Template Registry
(`spec-prompt-registry.md`). Templates with `cache_hint = true` are wrapped with
`cache_control` by the gateway's `_build_messages()` method. No changes are required
at the agent level — agents declare their templates as usual; caching is applied
transparently by the gateway.

Cache hit metrics are surfaced as `axiom_llm_cache_hit_ratio`
(see `spec-observability.md` §3.1).
